# Sentiment-Analyzer:
## Different sort of architecture im trying to implement which i was not aware about when i was just learning something

#### We can have data from multiple client.
#### Every data is suppose to keep it in a separate way.
Suppose we have a cliet domino's and another client facebook.
We have to build sentiment analyzer for both the data but dont want to repeat the whole process.
#### It will we one project where we will be able to handle any no of client with their own data.
#### For different userid and projectid we can have different model
#### For prediction we can use that userid and projectid for getting the model which is trained on that particular client data
