# Sentiment-Analyzer:
## Differet sort of architecture im trying to implement which i was not aware about when i was just learning something

#### We can have data from multiple client.
#### Every data is suppose to keep it in a separate way.
Suppose we have a food client and another client from health care.
We have to build sentiment analyzer for both the data but dont want to redo the things again and again.
#### It will we one project where we will be able to handle any no of client with their own data.
#### For different userid and project we can have different model
